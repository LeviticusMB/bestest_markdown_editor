# Bestest Markdown Editor for Redmine

This plugin supercharges Redmine's Markdown editor using [EasyMDE](https://github.com/Ionaru/easy-markdown-editor/) (a fork of [SimpleMDE](https://github.com/sparksuite/simplemde-markdown-editor)).

Not yet using Markdown in Redmine? You should [migrate](https://github.com/Ecodev/redmine_convert_textile_to_markown), because you *need* this plugin. Just look at the screenshot below!
